# Medical-Q.A-System-based-on-Knowledge-graph

__Abstract:__    
The advent and evolution of search engines have significantly enhanced the ease and convenience in people's daily lives, but with the increasing refinement of people's needs, the precision of search content is also increasingly required. Among many search fields, people's attention to __medical and health care__ is increasing day by day. Additionally, the process of effectively extracting relevant information from complex data has become a pertinent and novel topic of discussion. In this context, this project will investigate the ———————__retrieval and diagnosis of diseases__ with the help of __deep learning__ and __knowledge graphs__, starting from the crawling of medical information, the storage of triads, the construction of knowledge graphs to the recognition of entities, the analysis of semantics and the implementation of question and answer functions, so as to make a contribution to the field of medical consultation on the basis of appropriate innovation.
